    "faqTitle3": "QUESTIONS",
    "faqTips": "If you have any questions for which you couldn't find an answer, don't hesitate to reach out to our supportive community on Telegram and Discord. The Bitzing Team is here to provide you with assistance!",
    "faqQuestion1": "What is Bitzing?",
    "faqAnswer1": "Bitzing is the first web3 entertainment platform, driven by our unique emphasis on engaging Raffle Boxes and Treasure Draw. Our platform transforms accessibility, allowing users to acquire high-value NFTs and  cryptocurrencies like $ETH at a fraction of their actual cost. Our platform's gamified elements also make NFT listing more compelling and attractive for sellers.",
    "faqQuestion2": "What is Bitzing's Raffle Box? ",
    "faqAnswer2": "Bitzing's Raffle Box offers an innovative way to acquire high-valued NFTs and $ETH. Each box contains NFTs listed on our website, with disclosed probabilities for each item. Additionally, you can sell your NFT within a specified time after the draw and receive a percentage of your investment back based on blockchain validations. Participants also earn points and $ETH upon selling their NFTs. These points can be exchanged for $BZG tokens in Q4, 2023 when the Mainnet is live.<br><br>Our integration with Opensea ensures seamless NFT acquisitions, and in case of a transaction failure, you will receive a refund for your invested amount. Coming soon, we will introduce customized Raffle Box and implement more cryptocurrencies on our platform.",
    "faqQuestion3": "How to participate in Bitzing's Raffle Box?",
    "faqAnswer3": "You will need to begin by transferring cryptocurrencies to your account. Once you have cryptocurrencies in your account balance, you can use them to join the draw. Your account balance is fully withdrawable to your wallet whenever you desire. Currently, we support $ETH and $USDT, and our future plans include expanding our support to include more cryptocurrencies. <br><br>To participate in the raffle with zero gas fees, ensure your account balance covers the box cost. Click the desired box, enter the unboxing window, and press \"Unbox\". You can open up to 10 boxes at once, saving time for multiple boxes of the same kind.",
    "faqQuestion4": "What causes changes in the contents of Raffle Box?",
    "faqAnswer4": "Bitzing constantly reviews the value of each NFT and ensures they are kept up to date. However, the value of certain NFTs can be volatile, resulting in fluctuations in the contents of the box.<br><br>At BITZING, the value of the item you acquire from a box follows the \"value acquired\" rule. If you acquire an item worth 1 ETH and its price increases by more than 1 ETH, you will not be able to obtain it. However, we will compensate you by refunding 100% of the value of the item at the time of acquisition. It is important to note that holding NFTs as assets may carry risks, as their value can decrease. Therefore, we recommend exchanging and selling them promptly to avoid potential losses.<br><br>If you wish to hold NFTs for future use, we advise reselling them as they maintain a fixed value.",
    "faqQuestion5": "What is Treasure Draw?",
    "faqAnswer5": "Besides Raffle Box, Bitzing offers Treasure Draw, a unique and enjoyable method for acquiring blue-chip NFTs. Treasure Draw provides a more accessible avenue for buyers to acquire valuable NFTs at a fraction of their original value, while also offering NFT holders an opportunity to sell their collections.",
    "faqQuestion6": "How to participate in Bitzing's Treasure Draw?",
    "faqAnswer6": "To participate in Treasure Draw, ensure your account has a sufficient balance. Visit the details page, enter the desired tickets, and make the purchase. A unique number will be assigned on the right side of the page. To maintain fairness, there's a limit on the number of tickets users can buy, calculated as  \"<span style=\"color:white\">Total Price/0.0001ETH/4<span>\".<br><br>Treasure Draw draws automatically when criteria are met, based on timing or maximum entries. The odds of winning depend on the number of purchased entries. If you don't win, your purchased entry ticket remains in your personal account as an NFT and can be transferred to your wallet.",
    "faqQuestion7": "How to initiate Treasure Draw? ",
    "faqAnswer7": "To create a draw, own any Bitzing certified NFT collections. Transfer the NFT to your Bitzing account, then click \"Create A Draw\" to begin.<br><br>Two modes are available:<br><br>1. <span style=\"color:white\">Limited Time Mode: </span>Set total price and sale time. Entry tickets are generated at 0.0001 ETH each. Participants purchase tickets for a free draw number. After the sale time, a draw determines the winner.<br><br>2. <span style=\"color:white\">Limited Quantity Mode:</span> Set total price and maximum sale time. Tickets are generated as \"total price/0.0001 ETH\". When all tickets sell, a draw picks the NFT winner. If the maximum sale time passes without all tickets sold, Bitzing refunds all purchasers.<br><br>Proceeds incur a 5% deduction as transaction fees, while the rest goes to the creator.",
    "faqQuestion8": "How do we ensure fairness?",
    "faqAnswer8": "To ensure transparency, Bitzing takes snapshots of Raffle Boxes contents when they change. On the Raffle Box details page, find the 7-day snapshot info. Reviewing this data allows you to see the NFTs and their reward IDs for each time period.<br><br>Our draw algorithm runs through a smart contract. You can examine the contract logic and verify the results on the blockchain. Compare the results with snapshot reward IDs for a transparent draw process.",
    "faqQuestion9": "How do I view the NFT I have unboxed? ",
    "faqAnswer9": "Once the box is opened, you have 60 seconds to decide: keep or sell the NFT. If no decision is made within 60 seconds, we'll auto-sell it. Selling deducts transaction fees, and the balance is transferred to your account. If kept, the NFT is added to your inventory. Access it through 'Inventory', where you can view and withdraw your NFTs anytime.",
    "faqQuestion10": "How to withdraw an NFT to my wallet? ",
    "faqAnswer10": "Click on your profile picture, then select \"Inventory\" to view all your NFTs. To withdraw NFTs to your wallet, click the \"Withdraw\" button below each NFT with gas fee. For cost efficiency, withdraw multiple NFTs simultaneously instead of one by one.",
    "faqQuestion11": "How can I withdrawal cryptocurrency? ",
    "faqAnswer11": "Once you decide to sell the NFT, any transaction fees will be deducted, and the remaining amount will be transferred to your balance. To withdraw your crypto, navigate to your profile picture and select \"Balance\". From there, click the corresponding button to initiate the withdrawal process. Please be aware that crypto withdrawals are subject to a processing fee, which will be deducted upon your request.",
    "faqQuestion12": "How does Bitzing reward me for inviting my friends to join the platform?",
    "faqAnswer12": "Bitzing's referral program offers you a chance to earn money by introducing the platform to friends and fellow NFT/crypto enthusiasts. Simply share your unique referral link, and with each purchase your friends make, you'll secure a commission. For every successful referral, you will enjoy 10% of the profit margin from every purchase of Raffle Box or Treasure Draw they make.",
    "faqQuestion13": "What are the Bitzing Disc NFTs?",
    "faqAnswer13": "In addition to the Blue-Chip NFTs, Bitzing Disc NFTs are assets found within Raffle Boxes, used to extend gameplay and enhance winning opportunities for Blue Chip NFTs. These Bitzing Disc NFTs hold no value outside of Bitzing’s ecosystem and are designed to be sold within 60 seconds, offering you the opportunity to recover ETH. They feature 9 different variations, including: Wooden Disc (0.001ETH), Rock Disc (0.002ETH), Steel Disc (0.005ETH), Bronze Disc (0.01ETH), Silver Disc (0.02ETH), Golden Disc (0.05ETH), Diamond Disc (0.1ETH), Gem Disc (0.2ETH), and the highest-ranking Galaxy Disc (0.5ETH). The prices vary depending on the rarity, with the Galaxy Disc NFT being the most valuable and the Wooden Disc being the least valuable.",
    "faqQuestion14": "Can I earn ETH and other cryptocurrencies by participating in Raffle Box?",
    "faqAnswer14": "Certainly! You can currently earn $ETH, and in the future, we plan to incorporate additional cryptocurrencies into the boxes.",
    "faqQuestion15": "What is Token War?",
    "faqAnswer15": "Token War is a multiplayer game where participants can deploy \"troops\" (USDT) to compete for prizes. The player who contributes the most troops wins the entire prize pool. Other players earn points based on their troop contributions.",
    "faqQuestion16": "How do I participate in Token War?",
    "faqAnswer16": "1. Ensure your Bitzing account has enough balance to deploy troops.<br>2. Enter the number of troops (USDT) you want to deploy. 1 USDT = 1 soldier.<br>3. Wait for the countdown to end and the combat to start. Combat starts once there are 2+ participants.<br>4. Return to claim your rewards if you win!",
    "faqQuestion17": "What are the rules of Token War?",
    "faqAnswer17": "- Each round has a 3 minute countdown. If only 1 player, countdown resets.<br>2.- If 2+ players when countdown ends, combat begins.<br>- If 3 players, countdown resets to 15 seconds. New players reset countdown to 15 secs.<br>- Winner gets entire prize pool (minus 5% fee for Bitzing). Others get points based on troops.",
    "faqQuestion18": "What is End War?",
    "faqAnswer18": "- End War starts when the cumulative prize pool from Token War rounds reaches a threshold.<br><br>- Initial duration is 10 mins. Players can contribute more troops to extend up to 10 mins max.<br><br>- Must contribute more troops than the current leader to extend. When countdown ends, winner randomly chosen based on winning ID.<br><br>- Winner gets combined prize pool (minus 5% Bitzing fee).",
    "faqQuestion19": "Is Token War fair?",
    "faqAnswer19": "Yes, Token War uses blockchain-compatible smart contracts for verification, auditing and operations. Bitzing covers gas fees. Refunds only if game conditions not met. Player info available on game page.",
    "faqQuestion20": "Can I get a refund?",
    "faqAnswer20": "Refunds are only provided if the minimum conditions to start the game are not met after you deploy troops."
