          exploiting bugs, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair
          advantage to you or any other person is considered cheating.
        </div>

        <div>
          Exploiting other Members is an equally serious offense. Scamming,
          account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the
          gaming experience for other Members is prohibited.
        </div>
        <h3 class="title">BEHAVIOUR</h3>
        <div>
          Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as
          griefing, throwing, spamming chat, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect
          our Members to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable
          entertainment environment. In determining whether a Member's behaviour
          is acceptable, we may take into consideration complaints made by other
          Members. We reserve the right to place restrictions on your Account
          and to refuse payouts of prizes if you fail to comply with this
          requirement.
        </div>
        <div>
          While we encourage you to report Members that are behaving in a
          disrespectful manner, falsely reporting another Member with the intent
          of restricting their gameplay is also unacceptable and may result in
          restrictions being placed on your Account.
        </div>
        <div>
          <b
            >We reserve the right to restrict offending Accounts as much as
            necessary to keep Bitzing a fun entertainment experience for all

          inoffensive, and not be otherwise objectionable. Any Handle that
          violates our standards or disrupts the community of Members must be
          changed. We reserve the right to place restrictions on your Account if
          you fail to comply with this requirement. In determining whether a
          Member's Handle is acceptable, we may take into consideration
          complaints made by other Members.
